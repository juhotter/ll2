No, the result is not always correct. Some values are "nan" or seem like an overflow.
I made a counter to check the false values:
	Sequential: up to 200
	Vectorized: around 100

SIMD_INST_RETIRED.ANY: This event counts the overall number of retired SIMD instructions

Retired instruction -> executed and its results are correct and visible in the architectural state (Leaves the retirement unit)

Changing datatype to double:

The false values decrease enormous:
	Sequential: around 10
	Vectorized: <10

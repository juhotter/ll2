Problem size: 2048

Sequential: 4.3792 seconds
Vectorized: 0.3428 seconds

I made a counter to check false results: Yes, in both programs the result is still correct

SIMD_INST_RETIRED.ANY: This event counts the overall number of retired SIMD instructions

Retired instruction -> executed and its results are correct and visible in the architectural state (Leaves the retirement unit)

Changing datatype to double:

The sequential program gets slower by around 0.7sec
The Vectorized program gets slower by around 0.1sec
